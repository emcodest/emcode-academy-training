**Day 1: What is Vue.js?**

**Objective:**
- Understand what Vue.js is and its role in front-end web development.
- Set up a basic development environment for Vue.js.

**Introduction to Vue.js:**

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that is designed to help you build interactive, user-friendly web applications. It is often referred to as a "progressive" framework because you can incrementally adopt its features and integrate it into existing projects.

**Why Vue.js?**

1. **Ease of Learning:** Vue.js is known for its simplicity and ease of learning, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

2. **Flexibility:** It can be used for both small and large-scale projects.

3. **Performance:** Vue.js is designed for optimal performance in web applications.

4. **Ecosystem:** Vue.js has a vibrant ecosystem and an active community that continually develops and supports various plugins and libraries.

**Setting up a Development Environment:**

Before we start working with Vue.js, we need to set up a development environment. Here are the basic steps:

1. **Node.js and npm:** Vue.js relies on Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Ensure you have them installed on your computer. You can download them from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Vue CLI:** The Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool for quickly setting up Vue.js projects. You can install it globally by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm install -g @vue/cli
   ```

3. **Create a Vue Project:** Once Vue CLI is installed, you can create a new Vue project by running:

   ```
   vue create my-vue-project
   ```

   Replace `my-vue-project` with the name of your project. Vue CLI will guide you through project setup options.

4. **Run the Development Server:** After creating your project, you can navigate to the project directory and run the development server with the following command:

   ```
   cd my-vue-project
   npm run serve
   ```

   Your Vue.js application will be available at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

**Conclusion:**

Today, we've learned what Vue.js is and why it's a valuable framework for front-end web development. We've also set up a basic development environment to get you started with Vue.js projects. In the upcoming days, we'll dive deeper into Vue.js concepts and features.

**Homework:**
- Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
- Install the Vue CLI globally on your computer.
- Create a new Vue project using Vue CLI and run the development server.
